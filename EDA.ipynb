#   EDA - Exploratory Data Analysis for spotify dataset
#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) means simply looking at your data for the first time to understand what’s inside, find mistakes, and see basic patterns.
### steps:
* Import Libraries
* Load data
* checking rows,columns,dtypes,shape,info,shape.
* identified duplicates ,missing values.
* Univariate analysis helps understand the distribution of each variable individually.
* Bivariate analysis helps us see how two variables are connected or affect each other. 
* A correlation matrix shows how strongly different numerical features are related to each other.
* A boxplot helps us spot unusual values and understand how the data is spread.
## Problem Statement
The goal of this EDA is to analyze Spotify music features and understand
how different audio characteristics such as popularity, energy, tempo,
and danceability are related to each other.

## IMPORT LIBRARIES
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
### These are the main libraries used in EDA. pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical operations, matplotlib and seaborn for visualization
## Load Dataset
df = pd.read_csv("spotify_analysis_dataset.csv")
## Rows
df.head()
#### Displays the first 5 rows of the dataset. Helps us quickly understand the structure, column names, and sample values.
## Dataset Shape
df.shape
#### Returns the number of rows and columns in the dataset. Helps us understand the dataset size and dimensionality.
## Column
df.columns
#### Lists all the column names present in the dataset. Helps us verify feature names and check if all expected columns exist
## Data Types
df.dtypes
#### Shows the data type (int, float, object, etc.) of each column.Helps identify numerical, categorical, and datetime variables
## Dataset Information
df.info()

#### Provides a summary of the dataset, including Number of non-null values Data types Memory usage Helps detect missing data and confirm data types.
## Missing Values Count
df.isnull().sum()
df = df.drop_duplicates()

#### Counts the number of missing values in each column. Helps identify features needing cleaning or imputation
## Check Duplicate Rows
df.duplicated().sum()

#### Counts how many duplicate rows exist in the dataset.
## Statistical Summary
df.describe()

#### Generates summary statistics for numerical columns, including Mean,Median,Standard deviation ,Minimum & maximum
## Univariate analysis
sns.histplot(df['energy'], kde=True)
plt.show()

sns.histplot(df['danceability'], kde=True)
plt.show()

#### Shows the distribution of energy and danceability features and helps identify skewness and spread of the data.
## Bivariate analysis
sns.scatterplot(x='danceability', y='popularity', data=df, hue='energy', alpha=0.5, palette='viridis')
plt.show()

#### Visualizes the relationship between danceability and popularity.Helps identify whether higher danceability leads to higher popularity
## Correlation Matrix
corr = df.select_dtypes(include=np.number).corr()
sns.heatmap(corr, cmap='viridis')
plt.show()

#### Shows the correlation between energy and tempo.Helps identify whether increasing tempo affects the energy level of songs.
## Boxplot to Detect Outliers
sns.boxplot(data=df.select_dtypes(include=np.number), palette="Set2")
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.show()


### The boxplot shows that duration_ms has a very large range, while all other features have very small values and appear compressed.
## Key Insights
• Popularity shows moderate relationship with danceability.
• Energy and tempo have a positive correlation.
• Duration_ms contains extreme outliers compared to other features.
• Most songs fall within a medium popularity range.
